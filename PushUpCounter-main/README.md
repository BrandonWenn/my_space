# PushUpCounter
A simple program using Mediapipe and OpenCV to count the number of Push Ups done. The main goal is to ensure proper form while doing Push Ups so as to achieve maximum effect. 

You may use the BasicPoseModule in your personal projects, changing the variables as necessary. The Pose Module is using mediapipe's Pose module. Refer to the image below for the different joints in the body that are detected.
